# WIP analysis workflow: MISegmentation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/snakemake-workflows/misegmentation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/snakemake-workflows/misegmentation)

This is a workflow that should compare segmentation performance of single cell segmentation masks generated via the `ImcSegmentationPipeline` (https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/ImcSegmentationPipeline).

## Authors

* Vito RT Zanotelli (@votti)

## Issues:
- Files were re-named for final export, so I am lacking the mapping
    of raw data -> published masks

## Datasets

This repository will host the segmentation performance comparison for 5 published dataset that were processed with the `ImcSegmentationPipeline`. Each analysis
will be separate branch in this repository, with the 'main' branch orchestrating everything.
